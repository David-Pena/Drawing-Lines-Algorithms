# Drawing-Lines-Algorithms

This is a brief compilation of some algorithms used to draw a line given two points (x,y), then we check the runtime of each one and determine the fastest.
- Basic algorithm (Using For loop)
- Basic algorithm (Using While loop)
- A better basic algorithm
- Incremental Algorithm
- Bresenham Algorithm
